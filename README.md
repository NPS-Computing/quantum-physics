# Quantum Physics
From about the beginning of the twentieth century experimental physics amassed an impressive array of strange phenomena which
demonstrated the inadequacy of classical physics. The attempts to discover a theoretical structure for the new phenomena led at first to a confusion in which it appeared that light, and electrons, behaved sometimes like waves and sometimes like particles. This apparent inconsistency was completely resolved in 1926 and 1927 in the theory called quantum mechanics.
